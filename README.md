Deep learning library in R environments 101

In this project, I share my study on how to use DeepLearning (DL) library in R.

Plan to do :
- basic usage of DL in R (H2O, MxNet, deepnet, etc)
- Performance comparison of DL libraries, supervised learning, and ensemble learning
- When and where to use DL

=============================

*1st commit*
basic usage of DL with H2O

p.s.: I use MNIST dataset as train an test example.
